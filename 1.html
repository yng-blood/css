    <h5> There is an blog on trafic rules in <i>no parking</i>.Well, it
        seems quite redundant to bring up the fact that people should not
         park their vehicles in No-Parking zones. However, it’s an 
         unfortunate reality that every year thousands of drivers
          breach this basic law provision. More importantly,
          nearly all the people guilty of parking in No-Parking
          spaces don’t have criminal backgrounds, and neither
           is there any malicious intent behind exhibiting
         this behavior.
        This means people mostly violate this law by mistake
         or when they don’t have any other parking
          option. Let’s try to dissect the reasons 
          that lead to the violation of this basic civic 
          law by many.  </h5>
